          <h2>Organic Food Blog Post</h2>
          <p class="description">
This blog post is my take on wether or not the health benefits of buying organic is worth the extra price! Should we be caving into the trends of buying organic or is it something that should be overlooked? Is <a href="https://medium.com/@kimberlykkpham/is-organic-food-really-that-much-better-8e58692ccf0c"target="_blank"> organic food</a> REALLY that much better?</p>

          <h2>Pandemic Learning Podcast</h2>
          <p class="description">
The pandemic changed all of our lives; people lost their jobs, loved ones, and so many valuable life experiences. We as students faced unprecented circumstances, seniors around the world lost their graduations, freshmen had their first year of college online, and most had to study online. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gunhaar-panjwani-299134506/podcast_penguins/s-AjyTjEXHK67?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank"> Join us</a> as we talk about our experience studying online, filled with funny, relatable, and unfortunate stories!

          <h2>Aurora Painting Video</h2>
          <p class="description">
We're gonna wind down today and let our creativity take over! Painting is something I enjoy to do but never have enough free time to do so. This time, we're gonna learn how to paint an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE494fnG3R0" target="_blank"> Aurora,</a> or also called the Northern Lights! They appear in a clear night sky as swirling rivers of greenish-blue light. They move and dance unpredictably; sometimes barely perceptible, then suddeninly growing vivid</p>

          <h2>Pandemic Psychology Research Article</h2>
          <p class="description">
            As a psychlogy minor, it only felt right to include an <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12450" target="_blank">article</a> about the pandemic and its effects on teachers as well. I thought this was super interesting to see how they also felt about the pandemic and to see if it differed from students. From our podcast, we've heard all of our opinions and the pros and cons of pandemic learning, but it's nice to read into both sides of the story too.</p>
